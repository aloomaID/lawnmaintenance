Thorndale is historically notable for containing a summer house of US President James Buchanan, which still stands and has been incorporated into a golf course and turned into a restaurant. The community contains the Thorndale Fire Station and Caln Elementary School, part of the Coatesville Area School District. Thorndale sits along SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale Line and is currently the last station stop on that line. It is also served by the SEPTA Route 135 bus.</p>
