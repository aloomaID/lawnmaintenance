            <h3>West Newton, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The town traces its roots to 1788, when a group of American pioneers to the Northwest Territory led by Gen. Rufus Putnam traveled overland from Massachusetts and stopped at this location to build boats. They then set out down the Youghiogheny River to the Monogahela and Ohio Rivers, ending their journey and founding the town of Marietta, Ohio. Former names of the town are Simeral's Ferry (also, Sumrill's Ferry), Oswegly (Sewickley) Old Town,: 99  and Robbstown.
